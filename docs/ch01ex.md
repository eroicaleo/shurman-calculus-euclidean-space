### 1.1.1.

Referring only to the field axioms, show that $0x = 0$ for all
$x âˆˆ R$.

**Proof**:

Use (m2), (d1), (a2), (m2), we have

$$ 
0x + x = 0x + 1x = (0 + 1)x = 1x = x
$$

Let $y$ be the additive inverse of $x$, then

$$ 
(0x + x) + y = 0x + (x + y) = 0x + 0 = 0x \\
x + y = 0
$$

So $0x = 0$

$\square$
